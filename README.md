# Music Events Near You
## Running the App
1. Type in your City or Address and press "Show Me The Music!"
* The City and Map are by default set to Orlando. It's where I live, so I'd like it to be the default when I share with friends.
- When "Show Me The Music!" is clicked, new buttons, a filter bar, and a list of music events will appear. Markers will also be placed on the map showing where each event venue is located.
- In grey are the venue names, and below are the individual performers playing at each event.
2. Clicking on the markers will show you the venue that it refers to.
3. Clicking the venue names in the list will show you where the venue is located on the map.
4. To filter by specific venue, type the venue name in the input bar, and click "Set Filter"
- To remove the filter, simply click "Remove Filter"
5. On the initial search, 50 events will be loaded. To load more events, simply click the "Load More Events" button.
- If available, 50 more events will be appended at the bottom of the list.
6. If you would like to change your city/neighborhood, simply type it into the input bar and press "Change Neighborhood"
7. Clicking the individual artist names will highlight the currently selected artist, as well as the other artists performing at the event on which you clicked.
